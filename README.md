This repository contains custom code that is used for fluorescent microscopy image analysis and reanalyzing the publicly available dataset. 
It can generate:
1. Synaptic puncta number, size, and distribution (ImageJ);
2. Puncta distribution in SIM (Matlab);
3. Highly enriched genes in certain cell types (Python).
